Simple Google App Engine RSVPs
==============================

A very basic Google App Engine RSVP system. I do weddings and parties. I'll be here all week, folks.

It's essentially just one RSVP form and a details page. It doesn't have a secret word system, because those are clunky.

It sends confirmation emails and theres a report you can view to see who's been RSVPing.
