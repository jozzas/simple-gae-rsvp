{"name":"Simple-gae-rsvp","body":"Simple Google App Engine RSVP\r\n=============================\r\n\r\nI am a very, very basic Google App Engine RSVP system. I do weddings and parties. I'll be here all week, folks.\r\n\r\nIt's essentially just one RSVP form and a details page. It doesn't have a secret word system, because those are clunky.\r\n\r\nIt sends confirmation emails and theres a report you can view to see who's been RSVPing.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n---------\r\n- A form that takes participant info and stores it\r\n- Automated confirmation emails\r\n- Confirmation screen on submission\r\n- Simple report for organisers to see who has RSVPed\r\n- Details page for displaying event details\r\n- Nothing else. That's the idea.\r\n\r\nOriginally loosely based on http://larry-laura-rsvp.googlecode.com\r\n\r\nPossible future features:\r\n- Optional \"email the organiser\" every time someone RSVPs\r\n- More configuration so that you don't have to change my details out all over the place\r\n- Option to pre-load invitees so you can see whose RSVP is outstanding\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\nYou deploy this thing yourself as a google app engine app.\r\nPrerequisites:\r\n- Google app engine utilities installed (you need these to deploy your site)\r\n- Google account and app engine app created (your deployment target)\r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\n- Download the source\r\n- Remove my details and replace with your own (especially app.yaml so you deploy to the right place)\r\n- Deploy to GAE using the app engine tools\r\n- Party","tagline":"A very basic Google App Engine RSVP system.
