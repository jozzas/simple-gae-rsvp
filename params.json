I do weddings and parties. I'll be here all week, folks.\r\n\r\nIt's essentially just one RSVP form and a details page. It doesn't have a secret word system, because those are clunky.\r\n\r\nIt sends confirmation emails and theres a report you can view to see who's been RSVPing.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n---------\r\n- A form that takes participant info and stores it\r\n- Automated confirmation emails\r\n- Confirmation screen on submission\r\n- Simple report for organisers to see who has RSVPed\r\n- Details page for displaying event details\r\n- Nothing else. That's the idea.\r\n\r\nOriginally loosely based on http://larry-laura-rsvp.googlecode.com\r\n\r\nPossible future features:\r\n- Optional \"email the organiser\" every time someone RSVPs\r\n- More configuration so that you don't have to change my details out all over the place\r\n- Separate config file so that all configuration is done in one place\r\n- Option to pre-load invitees so you can see whose RSVP is outstanding\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\nYou deploy this thing yourself as a google app engine app.\r\nPrerequisites:\r\n- [Python](http://http://python.org/) 2.6 or later\r\n- [Google app engine SDK](http://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads) for Python\r\n- A place to deploy to: You need a Google account and [empty app engine app created](http://appspot.com) (your_project_name.appspot.com address)\r\n\r\nCreating Your Site\r\n------------------\r\n- Download and extract the source\r\n- Remove any existing details and replace with your own in `app.yaml`, all template HTML, variables in `main.py`\r\n- Test on your local computer by running `dev_appserver.py path_to_your_app` from the SDK and point a browser at `http://localhost:8080`\r\n- Deploy to GAE site using the app engine tools: `appcfg.py update name_of_app_folder/`\r\n- Share the link and watch the RSVPs roll in\r\n- Party!\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
